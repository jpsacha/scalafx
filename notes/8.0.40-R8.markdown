[ScalaFX][1] 8.0.60-R9 was tested against JavaFX 8.0.40. 
This release adds wrappers for new features in JavaFX 8u40.

Compatibility braking changes:

* Issue #163: `content` property naming conflict with JavaFX 8u40. Usage of `content` property in ScalaFX where it was referring to `children` property in JavaFX was deprecated in v.8.0.31-R7, and is now removed in ScalaFX 8.0.60-R9. You need to use `children` to access `childrenProperty` in JavaFX, and `content` to access `contentProperty`.
* To follow the same naming approach, use of `content` in `Scene` and `SubScene` was deprecated. You should use `children` instead.

New features (JavaFX 8u40):

* Issue #162: Support Dialogs and Alerts. See examples in those [this blog post][4]
* Issue #158: Add Spinner and SpinnerValueFactory classes. See examples in [this blog post][5]
* Add TextFormatter and new properties in TextInputControl. See examples in those two [blog][6] [posts][7].
* Add new class VertexFormat.
* Add wrappers for new properties in: LineChart, Node, Platform, ScrollPane, TriangleMesh.
* Issue #160: Support new accessibility properties added to Node
* Updated TreeItem constructors 
    
Bug fixes:

* Issue #180: `Bindings.select` methods throw "property ... doesn't exists" exceptions.

To use ScalaFX add following to your SBT:

``` scala

```
