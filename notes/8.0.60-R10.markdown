[ScalaFX][1] 8.0.60-R9 was tested against JavaFX 8.0u60.
This is primarily compatibility upgrade (for new JavaFX 8.0u60 API) and bug-fix release. 


Compatibility braking changes:

* [Issue #X][X]: 

Ability to use simpler lambdas for event handlers. 
In most cases it is not not necessary to explicitly provide type for lambda argument. For instance, instead of

```
button.onAction = (ae=>ActionEvent) => { println("Button pressed") }
```

now it can be written as:

```
button.onAction = _ => { println("Button pressed") }
```

or if you want to use evengt information:

```
button.onAction = e => { println("Button pressed, event: " + e) }
```

Unfortunately it was needed to remove the old construct `handle {...}`, use instead `_ => {...}` as illustrated above.


To use ScalaFX add following to your SBT:

      libraryDependencies += "org.scalafx" %% "scalafx" % "8.0.60-R9"
